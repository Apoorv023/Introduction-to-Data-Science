# Introduction-to-Data-Science
This repository contains the project by me under the Introduction to Data Science course. The 'source_code.py' file contains the code for implementing 4 Machine learning algorithms which include decision tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
The dataset for the code has been taken from the site "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation"
The code gives the accuracy of each algorithm.
The code also implements cross validation.
The code also generates some plots.
